# w3c-quicky

Check your code according to w3c rules in fast and efficient way ðŸ”¥

## How to work with code? (For now)

- Install dependencies via `npm i`
- Start building process with watcher `npm start`
- Run script via `node ./dist/index.js`

## TODO:

- Add basic cli with ability to provide directory/file path to check
- Publish to npm as esm package
- Add configuration file with ignoring rules
- Setup github actions
- Add checksums and cache results?
